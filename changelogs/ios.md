## [1.2.7] - 2019-12-18
### Changed
- removed all traces of `UIWebView` from SDK. `UIWebView` is deprecated and app that use it will soon not allowed in App Store. 
- removing `UIWebView` from SDK causes that **`UIWebView` instances are not overlayed in recordings**. If you want all instances of `UIWebView` overlayed to protect potentially sensitive data, add the following line just after Smartlook setup.

```swift
// Swift
Smartlook.registerBlacklisted(object: UIWebView.self)
// OBJ-C
[Smartlook registerBlacklistedObject:UIWebView.class];
```

## [1.2.6] - 2019-12-02

- removed calls to UIWebView methods to avoid App Store warnings. 
- this causes that **in whitelisted UIWebView, sensitive fields are no longer overlayed**. In embedded web views, sensitive fileds are overlayed only in WKWebView from now.
